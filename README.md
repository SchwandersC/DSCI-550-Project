# DSCI-550-Project. Comment Sentiment Analysis on youtube videos (attached is more descriptive final report)
## I was interested to see if the sentiment of comments on youtube could help predict the overall like to dislike ratio
## I extracted comment data using google cloud and the youtube api with filtered video ids obtained through the following dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dmitrynikolaev/youtube-dislikes-dataset
## I used NLTK and Hugging Face to perform sentiment analysis
## I used multiple models in SK Learn for classification including SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted
## My results were that on their own comment sentiment wasn't the most accurate predictor, but more methods could be taken to filter and pre process data.
