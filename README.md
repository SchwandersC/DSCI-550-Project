# DSCI-550-Project. Comment Sentiment Analysis on youtube videos (attached is more descriptive final report)
## I was interested to see if the sentiment of comments on youtube could help predict the overall like to dislike ratio
## I extracted data using google cloud and the youtube api
## I used NLTK and Hugging Face to perform sentiment analysis
## I used multiple models in SK Learn for classification including SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted
## My results were that on their own comment sentiment wasn't the most accurate predictor, but more methods could be taken to filter and pre process data.
